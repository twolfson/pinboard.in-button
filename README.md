Another pinboard.in browser extension.

Written via [crossrider][crossrider] for cross-browser support.

## STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

## Goals

- Provide "native" non-popup bookmark interaction
- Provide UI hints (e.g. page is already bookmarked)

## Development

Open up Crossrider, create a new extension, switch to staging mode (enables `console.log`), enter debug mode, serve this repo (I suggest using `serve`), get to work.
